### Contributing targets to CAPRI?

CAPRI heavily relies on the willingness of structural biologists to offer the coordinates of complexes they just determined but didn’t publish yet, as targets for a CAPRI experiment (Round).

Complexes that qualify as targets for CAPRI must be structures (determined using x-ray crystallography, NMR or high resolution Cryo-EM) that have not yet been published or publicly described in the literature or the Internet. They must be complexes (dimers of higher order assemblies) where the protein moiety is bound to another protein, to an oligo peptide, to nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), oligosaccharides or lipids.  Protein assemblies comprising identical subunits (homo-oligomers) also qualify.

A CAPRI prediction Round is initiated each time a target (or a few targets) become available, and completed three to six weeks later. Offering your complex as a target for CAPRI should not delay publication, provided the target is offered just before the paper describing it is submitted.  You may also be assured that target information is kept strictly confidential until specified otherwise by you, the author. 

Over 50 structural biologists worldwide have offered targets to CAPRI in the past, with some doing so repeatedly (see our [contributors](/people/#contributors)). They have been personally acknowledged and cited in all CAPRI publications describing prediction results. More than once these results have also contributed new insights into the biological function of the corresponding complexes.  We very much hope therefore, that you will join their rank in the future.

If you are interested in offering a target, think a colleague of yours might be, or have any questions concerning your participation in CAPRI, please contact __Shoshana Wodak:__
