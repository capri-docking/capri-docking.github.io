Welcome to the CAPRI web site.

__CAPRI__ (<b>C</b>ritical <b>A</b>ssessment of <b>PR</b>edicted <b>I</b>nteractions) is a community wide initiative for testing computational algorithms in blind predictions of experimentally determined 3D structures of protein complexes, the "targets", provided to CAPRI prior to publication.

This site is intended to give you general news about CAPRI and for facilitating the sharing of software and useful tools related to CAPRI. 


**The 7th CAPRI evaluation meeting took place at the EMBL/EBI in Hinxton, UK, April 3-5**
