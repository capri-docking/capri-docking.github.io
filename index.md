Welcome to the CAPRI web site.

__CAPRI__ (<b>C</b>ritical <b>A</b>ssessment of <b>PR</b>edicted <b>I</b>nteractions) is a community wide initiative for testing computational algorithms in blind predictions of experimentally determined 3D structures of protein complexes, the "targets", provided to CAPRI prior to publication.

This site is intended to give you general news about CAPRI and for facilitating the sharing of software and useful tools related to CAPRI.

## CAPRI COVID-19 Open Science Initiative

The CAPRI community is mobilizing its resources and expertise to model the 3D structures
and interaction interfaces of __SARS-COV-2 - human protein complexes__ and larger assemblies (homo- or hetero-complexes) starting from experimentally determined structures (by x-ray diffraction or cryo-EM), or from predicted structure, of the individual components.


An important focus of our initiative is to prioritize relevant COVID-19 complexes that will be offered as target for community-wide CAPRI prediction Rounds. These prediction Rounds will be run as a collaborative undertaking where data, analyses and results will be closely integrated and widely shared, hopefully moving COVID-19 science fast forward.


Whenever possible our initiative will leverage COVID-19 efforts of CASP ([CASPcommons](http://predictioncenter.org/caspcommons/index.cgi)), the [SIB/Modeller](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/species/2697049) and the [MolSSI/BioExcel COVID initiative](https://covid.molssi.org) on predicting the 3D structure of individual proteins and collecting information about those. We intend to use as much as possible existing high-quality models or structures to predict the association modes of these proteins. 


The CAPRI community remains eager to continue to improve and test their modeling tools by taking on increasingly challenging prediction problems.  In the spirit of open science we hence call upon structural biologists working on COVID-19 related protein complexes to offer these complexes as targets for CAPRI prediction Rounds prior to publication (for details how this is done see [contributing targets](/contribute/#practical-aspects-how-to-contribute-a-target).)

If you are interested in joining our initiative or exploring a collaboration, please contact us at: [capri.docking@gmail.com](mailto:capri.docking@gmail.com)
