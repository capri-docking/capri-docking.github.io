The deadline for applying the EMBO course on [integrative modelling of biomolecular complexes](http://meetings.embo.org/event/18-biomol-interact) which will take place in Barcelona, from July 2nd to July 6th  is approaching quickly - May
1st!

Proteins and their intricate network of interactions are the mainstay
of any cellular process. Dissecting these networks at atomic detail is
invaluable, as this paves the route to a mechanistic understanding of
biological function and provides the first essential step toward the
development of new drugs. Because of the challenges associated with
experimental techniques, structural biologists have to resort more and
more these days to complementary computational methods.

This EMBO Practical Course will present docking-based computational
methods and related bioinformatics approaches, aiming at predicting
how proteins interact with other biomolecules or ligands. Lectures
will provide the theoretical background on state-of-the-art algorithms
for sampling and scoring docking models, describe the use of low- and
high-resolution information, and conservation- and coevolution-based
interfaces prediction methods. Further, protein-peptide and
protein-ligand interaction, as well as the young field of genome
structure determination from sequencing information will also be
covered to broaden the scope of the course beyond traditional
protein-protein interactions.

Roughly half of the EMBO Practical Course will consist of practical
sessions, during which the students will run computations on
interesting biological problems. Finally, to encourage interaction
between instructors and students and stimulate discussions, students
will be prompted to present their own research and problems during
dedicated sessions.
