Dear CAPRI friends


With this message we wish to update you on a change in the leadership of CAPRI.

Shoshana Wodak is facing challenging family health problems and is unable to continue leading CAPRI in this important transformation period of the protein structure prediction field.  She is therefore stepping down, with [Alexandre Bonvin](https://www.uu.nl/staff/amjjbonvin) replacing her at the helm of CAPRI.

Together with Marc Lensink, Alexandre will handle the daily management of CAPRI and will be the primary contact person for targets.

To ensure the continued role of CAPRI nurturing  progress in modeling protein complexes and assemblies in this new era of structural biology, it is crucial to secure a steady flow of new targets for various types of biomolecular complexes.

We therefore call for the entire CAPRI community to more proactively engage with colleagues generating experimental structures of protein complexes to offer those as targets to CAPRI.

Finally, we are happy to announce that there is a CAPRI meeting in preparation, which will most likely take place in Grenoble, France in the week of February 12, 2024. Make sure to mark the date in your calendars!


Wishing you a wonderful remainder of the summer

Shoshana, Alexandre and Marc
