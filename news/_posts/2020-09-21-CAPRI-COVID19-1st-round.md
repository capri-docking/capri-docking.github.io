We are happy to announce CAPRI Round 51. This is the first Round of the CAPRI COVID-19 Open Science initiative. Registration to the Round opens Sep 15, 2020  at the [CAPRI website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/complex-pred/capri/round/51).  


Prediction starts Sep 22, 2020.


A total of 4 targets: T182, T183, T184 and T185, will be offered in this Round. Three are complexes of SARS-COV-2 proteins with human host proteins (prioritized from the interaction proteomics study of Gordon et al. (2020) [1]) and the 4th target is a multi-component complex of SARS-COV-2 proteins and RNA.

All 4 targets will be released at once, with target details provided when predictions start: one week after registration starts. This Round will include, as usual, submissions by servers, human predictors, and a scoring challenge. The timelines will however be longer than for usual CAPRI targets.

Servers will be given ~3 weeks to submit models, human predictors ~10 weeks, and scorers ~4 weeks.
Round 51 will be conducted in the spirit of open science. Models submitted by all groups/teams will be made immediately available online after the submission deadline in full transparency. Since for many of the considered targets, experimental structures may not be available for some time to evaluate predicted models, participating groups will work together to evaluate the quality of submitted models, compare and rank them on the basis of agreed-upon criteria and derive consensus predictions whenever appropriate. The protocol for this evaluation will be worked out after the Round is completed.  We remind everyone that the plan is to report the results of this collective effort in a common publication coauthored by members of all participating groups/teams.
