# 8th CAPRI evaluation meeting, Grenoble, France, 2023

The 8th CAPRI evaluation meeting took place in Grenoble, February 14-16 2023, following the Integrative Computational Biology workshop and 8th CAPRI assessment meeting.
 
The Integrative Computational Biology workshop aimed at gathering structural biologists studying challenging systems and mathematicians and computer scientists who might have ideas on how to model proteins' behavior, predict their biophysical properties, and analyze experimental data. One of the goal was to present the current state-of-the-art in different branches of structural biology and discuss the need for new algorithms with the modeling community. It was followed by the 8th CAPRI evaluation meeting starting in the afternoon of February 14th.
