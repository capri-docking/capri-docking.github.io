# About

Get the latest update on the current status of computational procedures for modeling protein-protein interactions and the association of proteins with other macromolecules from this 7th CAPRI evaluation meeting. For more information - <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/capri/>

CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions) is a community wide experiment designed to test methods for predicting the structure of macromolecular complexes based on the known structure of their components.

The meeting program will include an overview of the performance of protein docking and scoring procedures obtained for targets evaluated since the spring of 2013. It will also feature several plenary lectures by prominent scientists, as well as talks by the best CAPRI performers, and/or groups developing innovative computational approaches. CAPRI groups selected for oral representations will be notified, once the predictions for all outstanding targets have been completed.

We hope to see you all in Hinxton in April!

## Abstract Submission

Important guidelines for participants

A one page Abstract should be submitted for both oral and poster presentations. The deadline for Abstract submission is set to **March 3 2019**. Selected speakers will be notified by **March 11 2019**. Please email your abstract in Microsoft word format to <info@bioexcel.eu>.

Following the tradition of the meeting, the selected speakers will also be invited to contribute to the special issue of Proteins dedicated to CAPRI that will be published late 2019.

# Instruct-ERIC Workshop

Registration now open for the Joint Instruct-ERIC/CAPRI Workshop on Integrated Modelling of Protein-Protein Interactions Workshop. The course will run prior to the 7th CAPRI Assessment Meeting, from the 1st - 2nd April 2019 at EMBL-EBI, Hinxton, UK. 

The course will consist of six sessions followed by a practical component overseen by the lecturer and an additional tutor. During the computer practicals, participants will learn to use and apply the various software with either their own data/structures, or with examples provided by the instructors.

# Registration

Registration is free for participants from Instruct-ERIC countries and £250 from other countries. Visit the website to find out if you are from a participating Instruct-ERIC country. <https://instruct-eric.eu/countries>
