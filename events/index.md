# About

Get the latest update on the current status of computational procedures for modeling protein-protein interactions and the association of proteins with other macromolecules from this 7th CAPRI evaluation meeting. For more information - http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/capri/

CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions) is a community wide experiment designed to test methods for predicting the structure of macromolecular complexes based on the known structure of their components.

The meeting program will include an overview of the performance of protein docking and scoring procedures obtained for targets evaluated since the spring of 2013. It will also feature several plenary lectures by prominent scientists, as well as talks by the best CAPRI performers, and/or groups developing innovative computational approaches. CAPRI groups selected for oral representations will be notified, once the predictions for all outstanding targets have been completed.

A hands-on workshop on integrative modeling of protein-protein interactions and larger multi-molecular assemblies will be held on prior to the start of the meeting introducing participants to state-of-the-art computational methods and web-servers.

We hope to see you all in Hinxton in April!

The registration fee for participants is set to £260 which includes:

3 days of scientific sessions including coffee-breaks and lunch on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday\
Ongoing access to the poster area\
Certificate of attendance\
Conference dinner


All participants (excluding keynote speakers) are requested to pay the registration fee. Depending on availability of funds, a contribution towards travel and accommodation expenses will be provided to the selected speakers and plenary lecturers. Speakers will be notified by e-mail regarding the reimbursement policy.

Registration fee should be paid no later than **15 February 2019**. Late registration after that date will however remain possible.

Accomodation is not included in the registration fee, but we have listed our recommendations for several hotel options in Cambridge. 

[ **Register Now »** ](https://embl.ungerboeck.com/prod/emc00/register.aspx?OrgCode=20&EvtID=5687&AppCode=REG&CC=118121116742)

# Abstract Submission

Important guidelines for participants

A one page Abstract should be submitted for both oral and poster presentations. The deadline for Abstract submission is set to **February 28 2019**. Selected speakers will be notified by **March 11 2019**. Please email your abstract in Microsoft word format to <info@bioexcel.eu>.

Following the tradition of the meeting, the selected speakers will also be invited to contribute to the special issue of Proteins dedicated to CAPRI that will be published late 2019. Participants who apply for a regular talk should thus present work that is publishable and agree to contribute a manuscript for the Proteins special issue.

# Accomodations

Accomodation is **not** provided for this event. Attendees are requested to arrange their own if required. It is strongly advised to book accommodation a month in advance as room prices tend to increase substantially closer to the date.
