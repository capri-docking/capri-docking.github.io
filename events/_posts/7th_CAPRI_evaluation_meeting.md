Dear Capriotes and all interested,


We are happy to announce that the **7th CAPRI evaluation meeting will be held at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), Hinxton UK, on April 3-5, 2019.**
 
## PLEASE SAVE THE DATE
 

As the tradition of CAPRI has it, the meeting will discuss progress achieved and remaining challenges in modeling protein interactions and assemblies. 
The program of the meeting will include talks by the best CAPRI performers for the evaluated targets, plenary lectures outlining recent developments likely to impact the assembly-modeling field, short talks by students and post doctoral fellows, and a lively poster session. 


**Further details about the meeting will be provided in the fall.**
 

The meeting is open to anyone interested in protein docking and assembly modeling procedures. 


We very much hope to see you all in Hinxton in April 2019,
 


The CAPRI Management Committee
