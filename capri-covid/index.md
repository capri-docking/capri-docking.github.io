### Methodology
The results presented are of the Scorer submissions of Targets 181-184.

*Contacts:* Contacts between entities were determined using a 5 Å distance threshold. Clashes (contacts below 2.5 Å), if any, were ignored. Only inter-chain contacts were considered.

Only heteromeric contacts were kept. Then, for all models, we counted the number of contacts (defined as “contact hits”), the number of contacts a residue makes at the interface (defined as “residue hits”), and the number of different residues a residue interacts with (defined as “contact variability”).

*Sequence conservation:* Sequence conservation was calculated using [Rate4Site](https://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/cp/rate4site.html). Here, a low score means good conservation.
