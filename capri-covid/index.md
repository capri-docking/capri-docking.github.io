### Methodology
Here we present results of the CAPRI - Covid19 Round Target181-184 Scoreset.

*Contacts:* Contacts between entities were determined using a 5 Å distance threshold. Clashes (contacts below 2.5 Å), if any, were ignored. Only inter-chain contacts were considered.

In case of multiple chains, we only kept heteromeric contacts. Then, through all the models, we counted these contacts (defined as “contact hits”), we counted  the number of contacts a residue makes at the interface (defined as “residue hits”) and the number of residues a residue interacts with (defined as “contact variability”).

*Sequence conservation:* Sequence conservation was calculated with [Rate4Site](https://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/cp/rate4site.html). Here, a low score means good conservation.

### Target 181
The T181 Scoreset is made of 180 Models

#### Target description

|Type|Ligand|Receptor|
|---|---|---|
|Species|*SARS-CoV-2*|*Homo sapiens* (Human)|
|Name|Orf3a|HMOX1|
|Uniprot ID|P0DTC3|P09601|
|Template|6XDC|1N3U|
|Description|Plays a role in virus egress via lysosomal trafficking (PubMed:33157038, PubMed:33422265).<br>Forms homotetrameric ion channels (viroporin) localized at endosomes and lysosomes, that may induce deacidification of lysosomes thereby allowing safe virion egress through lysosomal trafficking (By similarity) (PubMed:33157038, PubMed:33422265).<br>Also blocks formation of autolysosomes through binding and sequestering host TMUB1/HOPS on late endosomes. This prevents fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, disrupting autophagy and facilitating virus egress (PubMed:33422265).|Heme oxygenase cleaves the heme ring at the alpha methene bridge to form biliverdin. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. Under physiological conditions, the activity of heme oxygenase is highest in the spleen, where senescent erythrocytes are sequestrated and destroyed. Exhibits cytoprotective effects since excess of free heme sensitizes cells to undergo apoptosis.|
