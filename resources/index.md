### Software tools

  * [**PDB-tools**](http://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools):
  A collection of Python scripts for the manipulation (renumbering, changing chain and segIDs...) of PDB files. A contribution from the [BonvinLab](http://bonvinlab.org) (developed by Jo√£o Rogrigues)

### Web portals

#### Conformational changes / sampling

  * [**ModFlex**](http://modflex.org/):
  A web resource developed by the Godzik's lab that provides information about structural changes undergone by the set of homologs in the PDB to a query sequence. The posted version is an _alpha_ version, which the Godzik group intend to develop further shortly. Any comments and suggestions for improvements will be most welcome and should be sent directly to Adam Godzik ([adam@sbpdiscovery.org](mailto:adam@sbpdiscovery.org)).

  * [**Contemplate**](http://bental.tau.ac.il/contemplate/):
  A web portal developed by the Nir BenTal's group that allows you to find alternate conformations by comparison with homologues in the PDB - can provide a list of template and/or modeled structures.
