### Contributing software and resources to this web site?

Do you want your software / database or web portal to be listed in the resources pages of our CAPRI web site?
One requirement is that it should be freely accessible to the community (at least for non-profit users).

Interested? Then please send the following information to capri.docking_[at]_gmail.com :

- Name of the software/resource
- Name of the group providing it (and web link to the group)
- Short test description of what it does / contains / offers
- web link to the software/resource
- Name and email of a contact person in case of problems with the resource (or alternatively web link of a support forum). 

Your request will be subjected to review by the CAPRI committee.

### Software tools

  * [**PDB-tools**](http://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools):
  A collection of Python scripts for the manipulation (renumbering, changing chain and segIDs...) of PDB files. A contribution from the [BonvinLab](http://bonvinlab.org) (developed by João Rogrigues).

  * [**FCC** - Fraction of common contact clustering](http://github.com/haddocking/fcc): Clustering of biomolecular complexes based on the fraction of common contacts. A contribution from the [BonvinLab](http://bonvinlab.org) (developed by João Rogrigues).

  * [**KPAX**](http://kpax.loria.fr/): A protein structure aligner that calculates pair-wise, multiple, and flexible, structure alignments. Can also be used to search structural databases (e.g. SCOP, CATH, ECOD). Provides several output formats for visualisation in [Hex](http://hex.loria.fr) and [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), and can be used to generate input scripts for homology modeling by [Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/). Kpax was developed by [Dave Ritchie](https://members.loria.fr/DRitchie/).

### Web portals

  * [**HADDOCK**](http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2): HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein-protein DOCKing) is an information-driven flexible docking approach for the modeling of biomolecular complexes. HADDOCK allows to include information from various sources, e.g. identified or predicted protein interfaces, as restraints to guide the docking process. HADDOCK can deal with a large class of modelling problems including protein-protein, protein-nucleic acids and protein-ligand complexes. A contribution from the [BonvinLab](http://bonvinlab.org). For support, check the [HADDOCK BioExcel forum](http://ask.bioexcel.eu/c/haddock).

  * [**KBDOCK**](http://kbdock.loria.fr/): A protein domain interaction database for studying 3D domain-domain interactions and for proposing homology templates for protein docking. KBDOCK was developed by [Anisah Ghoorah](https://sites.google.com/a/uom.ac.mu/anisah-ghoorah/), a former member of [Dave Ritchie's group](https://members.loria.fr/DRitchie/).

### Conformational changes / sampling

  * [**ModFlex**](http://modflex.org/):
  A web resource developed by the Godzik's lab that provides information about structural changes undergone by the set of homologs in the PDB to a query sequence. The posted version is an _alpha_ version, which the Godzik group intend to develop further shortly. Any comments and suggestions for improvements will be most welcome and should be sent directly to Adam Godzik ([adam@sbpdiscovery.org](mailto:adam@sbpdiscovery.org)).

  * [**Contemplate**](http://bental.tau.ac.il/contemplate/):
  A web portal developed by the Nir BenTal's group that allows you to find alternate conformations by comparison with homologues in the PDB - can provide a list of template and/or modeled structures.

### Databases

  * [Protein-protein docking benchmark 5](https://zlab.umassmed.edu/benchmark/)

  * [CAPRI scoring decoys database](http://cb.iri.univ-lille1.fr/Users/lensink/Score_set/)

  * [Dockground benchmark sets](http://dockground.compbio.ku.edu)

  * [Protein-protein affinity database 2.0](https://bmm.crick.ac.uk/~bmmadmin/Affinity/)

  * [SKEMPI database of kinetics and energetics of mutant protein interactions](https://life.bsc.es/pid/mutation_database/)
